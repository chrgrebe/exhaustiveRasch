# exhaustiveRasch
# Automation of the item selection Processes for rasch scales by means of exhaustive search for suitable Rasch models (dichotomous, partial credit, rating-scale) in a list of item-combinations. The item-combinations to test can be either all possible combinations or item-combinations can be defined by several rules (forced inclusion of specific items, exclusion of combinations, minimum/maximum items of a subset of items). Tests for model-and item-fit include ordering of the thresholds, itemfit-indices, likelihood ratio test, Martin LÃ¶f test, waldtest, person-item distribution and empirical representation of all raw scores. The tests, their ordering and their parameters can be defined. For parameter estimation and model tests  functions of the packages eRm, psychotools or pairwise can be used.
