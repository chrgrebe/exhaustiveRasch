\arguments{
\item{dset}{a data.frame containing the data}

\item{modelType}{a character value defining the rasch model to fit. Possible values: RM, PCM, RSM}

\item{combos}{a list of item combinations to be tested, e.g. from \link{apply_combo_rules} or from $passed_combos of the value of a previous call to this function. If NULL, all possible combinations of the items (columns) in dset will be tested}

\item{scale_length}{a numeric vector defining the length of the item combinations to test}

\item{na.rm}{a boolean value. If TRUE, in the respective pattern all cases with any NA are removed (na.omit). If FALSE, only cases with full NA responses are removed. NOTE: \link{test_mloef} currently does not allow for missing values (because erm::MLoef doesn't). If  \link{test_mloef} is under the tests to perform, na.rm will automatically be set TRUE for ALL tests.}

\item{tests}{a vector of characters defining the tests to perform. Possible values: all_rawscores, test_itemfit, test_LR, test_mloef, test_pca, test_waldtest, threshold_order, test_DIFtree. Tests will be performed in the given order.}

\item{itemfit_param}{a list from \link{itemfit_control} with options for \link{test_itemfit}}

\item{splitcr_mloef}{as defined by eRm::MLoef: Split criterion to define the item groups. "median" and "mean" split items in two groups based on their items' raw scores. splitcr can also be a vector of length k (where k denotes the number of items) that takes two or more distinct values to define groups used for the Martin-LÃ¶f Test.}

\item{splitcr_LR}{as defined by eRm::LRtest. Split criterion for subject raw score splitting. "all.r" corresponds to a full raw score split, "median" uses the median as split criterion, "mean" performs a mean split. Optionally splitcr can also be a vector which assigns each person to a certain subgroup (e.g., following an external criterion). This vector can be numeric, character or a factor.}

\item{splitcr_wald}{as defined by eRm::Waldtest: Split criterion for subject raw score splitting. median uses the median as split criterion, mean performs a mean-split. Optionally splitcr can also be a dichotomous vector which assigns each person to a certain subgroup (e.g., following an external criterion). This vector can be numeric, character or a factor.}

\item{alpha}{a numeric value for the alpha level. Will be ignored for \link{test_itemfit} if use.pval in \link{itemfit_control} is FALSE}

\item{bonf}{a boolean value wheter to use a Bonferroni correction. Will be ignored if use.pval is FALSE}

\item{DIFvars}{a data.frame containing the variables and their data to use for differential item functioning analysis with \link{test_DIFtree}}

\item{ignoreCores}{a numeric value for the number of cpu cores to hold out in parallelizing the test run.}

\item{...}{options for \link{itemfit_control} can be passed directly to this function.}
}
\value{
a list containing 4 lists: the process log, the item combinations that passed the test circuit, the corresponding RM/PCM/RSM models and their information criteria (AIC, BIC, cAIC)
