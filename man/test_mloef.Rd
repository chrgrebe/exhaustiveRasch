\title{runs Martin-Loef Test using the MLoef() function of eRm.}
\usage{
test_mloef(
  items = NULL,
  dset = NULL,
  na.rm = TRUE,
  model = NULL,
  modelType = NULL,
  splitcr = "median",
  alpha = 0.1,
  estimation_param = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{items}{a numeric vector containing the index numbers of the items in
dset that are used to fit the model}

\item{dset}{a data.frame containing the data}

\item{na.rm}{a boolean value. If TRUE, all cases with any NA are removed
(na.omit). If FALSE, only cases with full NA responses are removed}

\item{model}{a list of type RM, PCM or RSM (a previously fit model)
matching the value of modelType. If model is provided, this model is used.
 If NULL, a model is fit using dset and items.}

\item{modelType}{a character value defining the rasch model to fit.
Possible values: RM, PCM, RSM}

\item{splitcr}{as defined by eRm::MLoef: Split criterion to define the
item groups. "median" and "mean" split items in two groups based on their
 items' raw scores. splitcr can also be a vector of length k (where k
 denotes the number of items) that takes two or more distinct values to
  define groups used for the Martin-LÃ¶f Test.}

\item{alpha}{a numeric value for the alpha level. Will be ignored if
use.pval is FALSE}

\item{estimation_param}{options for parameter estimation using
\link{estimation_control}}
}
\value{
if the p-value of the test is not significant (above p=0.05),
 a list containing two elements is returned: the pattern that was tested
  an a list of type RM, RCM or RSM (depending on modelType) with the fit
   model. If the test is significant (p<0.05), NULL is returned.
