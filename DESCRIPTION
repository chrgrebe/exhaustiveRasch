Description: Exhaustive search for possible Rasch-models (Dichotomous, Partial Credit, Rating-Scale) in a list of item-patterns. The item-patterns to test can be either all possible patterns or item-patterns can be defined by several rules (forced inclusion of specific items, exclusion of sub-patterns, minimum/maximum items of a sub-pattern). Tests for model-and item-fit include ordering of the thresholds, itemfit-indices, likelihood ratio test, Martin LÃ¶f test, waldtest, principal component analysis with tetra-/polychoric correlations and rempirical representation of all raw scores. The tests, their ordering and their parameters can be defined. Item- and person-parameters are estimated as conditional likelihood estimation using functions of the eRM-package.
